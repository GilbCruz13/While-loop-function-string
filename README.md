# While-loop-function-string

Good day!
Im new on git hub, so im trying my best to learn this fun platform

This script is a small project I was practicing

I wanted this script to interact with the terminal so I created a function that returns and interrogation symbol if an sentence starts with "how, why, what, whats, when" etc.
After that created a while loop that breaks the loop when you use "\end"

I use Python 3.10, feel free to add or replace items
